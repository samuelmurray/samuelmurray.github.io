I was a PhD student in machine learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, 2017-2019, supervised by Hedvig Kjellström and Jana Tumova. My research was on probabilistic models, and on how prior knowledge could be used in model design.

My project was part of [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program](https://wasp-sweden.org/).
