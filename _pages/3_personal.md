In my personal time, I enjoy [_running in the forest looking for control points_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering). 
I started off in IFK Liding√∂ SOK, but have since then switched clubs to [Centrum OK](https://www.centrumok.se). 
My biggest (and really, only) bragging point is placing 7th in the second day of [SIC 2023](https://www.stockholmindoorcup.se). 
If you happen to be in an orienteering club yourself, you can check out [my profile](https://eventor.orientering.se/Ranking/ol/Runner/Index/172648) at Eventor.

Video games have always been a part of my life. 
A few years ago, I started keeping track of all the games I play, documenting my playtime for games where such data is available.
If you are interested, you can view my profile on [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/user/Quizzy).

Another hobby of mine is _board games_. 
I particularly enjoy legacy-style games, where new elements are added to the game each session. 
I have played quite a few solo campaign games, i.e. games designed to be played solo, or with a special rule set for individual play.
