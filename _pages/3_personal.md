I have recently started [_running in the forest looking for control points_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering). My club is IFK Liding√∂ SOK, and I competed in our 4th team for the orienteering relay [25manna](http://www.25manna.se/en/) 2018. I have yet to compete in an individual competition, but once I do, you can see how I'm doing on [my profile](https://eventor.orientering.se/Ranking/ol/Runner/Index/172648) at Eventor.

Another hobby of mine is _board games_. I particularly enjoy legacy-style games, where new elements are added to the game each session. This year I also found out about solo games, i.e. games designed to be played solo, or with a special rule set for individual play.
